0	4220	Hail, noble cousin. Now, let's get you from that miserable place.
4720	8340	I'll see that all of us upon Olympus do our part, beginning here with me.
8860	12260	Keep fighting, cousin. Fight from out of that eternal gloom.
12600	15060	I trust you'll be joining us upon Olympus shortly.
15580	19700	I have your back, cousin. Rise now to your rightful station with my blessings.
20020	23500	May the light and fury of Olympus guide you from the dark, cousin.
24060	25640	I've a token of it for you here.
25640	27200	Push forward, noble cousin.
27700	32180	I shall be keen to see you circumvent the perils that the fates arranged for you this time.
32920	35220	Vanquish all who stand against you, noble cousin.
35720	39080	I and your relatives upon Olympus shall assist you in so doing.
39540	41500	Sometimes I think about what you've endured.
42220	45020	To have been living in that loathsome squalor, cousin.
45700	48160	I swear you'll have your justice.
49140	51860	Do not fear your father's cruel legions, cousin.
51860	57240	Their lives are long since forfeit, and they cannot stand against one of your birthright,
57680	59080	nor against my power.
59620	63100	Yours is a brazen plan of actions, Agrius, and I admire it.
63520	67500	The boldest strategy often prevails, especially with my support.
68420	73360	Take heart, cousin, for you have found me even in the suffocating darkness of the underworld.
73920	75960	May my power be of some assistance.
76580	79880	Your struggles have not gone unnoticed, cousin, so take heart.
79880	83080	Eternity awaits you once you finally break free.
83420	87520	Here on Olympus is the opposite of everything about that lifeless squalor you reside in,
87740	88260	Zagreus.
88540	90020	Fight on and come to us.
90840	93680	Cousin, I grow angry merely thinking of your situation.
94220	97980	May what power I can offer be of service as you struggle towards your fate.
98920	103900	Your father chose to sever ties with all of us, and stew alone within his land beneath the earth.
104400	106580	But you are not beholden to his actions.
107340	107780	Fight.
108320	110580	Your labors make you stronger, noble cousin,
111100	114120	and the blessings I now offer ought to make you stronger still.
114680	117700	I've found you once again, dear cousin, and my strength is yours,
118160	120860	so much of it as I can send there to the bowels of the earth.
121340	124000	I'm here again to lend to you my power, noble cousin,
124340	128120	though your own strength of will is how you'll finally break free of that cruel place.
128620	133720	I'm pleased to see your father's stubbornness is manifest in you as such determination, Zagreus.
134160	135540	My blessing be with you.
135540	139000	What wretched fools dare stand against you, cousin.
139500	142840	Punish them so that they learn something they ought have learned in life.
143760	147060	Hold fast to your resolve, cousin, and climb on toward the surface.
147620	150660	No matter how often your foothold falters, I am here.
151080	156860	For you, my cousin Zagreus, I wish to offer the most potent of the blessings I am able to bestow.
157320	160440	Make wise your use of this, and rise toward us.
160780	164580	The circumstances spur me now to offer you the greatest of my powers, cousin.
164580	167940	Take my strength, and strike the darkness down.
169100	172980	May wisdom and good fortune guide you toward the light of day this time, cousin.
173560	176720	The underworld's wretched dead shall fear you yet, cousin.
177320	180220	Strength and wisdom guide you from the darkness, Zagreus.
180900	184820	The low cunning of your lifeless enemies is not a match for your divine might.
185540	188440	Remember, I am always watching over you, dear cousin.
189140	192240	You'll have your justice in due course, cousin, I promise you.
192240	196300	The might and fury of Olympus courses through you, noble cousin.
197420	200920	I so look forward to our meeting face to face amongst the gods, dear cousin.
201500	204040	Olympus shall be merrier and wiser once you're here.
204760	206940	Hail and good tidings to you, noble cousin.
207360	211040	May you be swift and thorough vanquishing the dead who dare oppose you.
211580	213320	Cousin, you've met Aphrodite now?
213600	217780	She likes beguiling others with her charms, but her intentions with you, I believe, are pure.
218400	220520	You'll find our strengths are complementary.
220520	223500	I understand you've been in contact with my father.
224080	225320	Your uncle Zeus, I mean.
225840	227440	He's taken interest in your plight.
227680	228660	You should feel honored.
229400	232200	You've met the master of the seas, Poseidon, haven't you?
232740	234700	Our uncle's affable but quick to anger.
235320	237180	Be on your guard with him, is my advice.
237540	239980	My warlike brother Ares reached you, didn't he?
240380	242860	I've always found his conduct quite disturbing.
243540	245340	At least it seems he's helping you for now.
245660	247020	I'll tell you something, cousin.
247020	250860	If even Artemis is aiding you, it's proof your cause is just.
251200	253860	She doesn't often take an interest in family affairs.
254740	256780	Did Dionysus truly visit you before?
257320	259940	He tends to seek out revelry, not conflict.
260500	262820	I'm pleased to know he's making himself useful here.
263620	265500	You're nothing like your father, Zagreus.
265900	267140	I mean that as a compliment.
268040	270000	He cut himself off from the rest of us.
270540	273000	Many times have we attempted peace to no avail.
273860	278160	It's such a cruelty that your father hid the knowledge of your birth and life from us, my cousin.
278760	279580	It's unacceptable.
280760	282760	You've met your distant relatives by now.
283080	285880	We don't all share the same demeanor nor see eye to eye.
286140	288580	Though all of us, I think, wish you the best.
288800	289900	The one called Nix.
290500	292100	She is your mother, as I understand.
292760	295340	We Olympians rarely consort with the Chthonic gods.
295940	299440	Though Nix herself reached out to me about your plight and I was spurred to act.
300020	302360	Please send the goddess Nix my kind regards.
302360	305600	That she supports you in your effort to escape her own domain
305600	308260	suggests a selflessness I would not have expected.
309160	312860	Your father Hades and my father Zeus have not communicated in some time
312860	315040	and Zeus refuses to explain.
315640	317960	Something transpired between the two of them.
318420	320140	Perhaps you know better than I.
320940	323500	There's something that I've wished to tell you, Zagreus.
323860	325600	There is no shame in your upbringing.
326380	330840	Many of us on Olympus, we likewise were born and raised under the strangest circumstances.
331440	333300	Someday I'll have to tell you about mine.
334340	336680	It comforts me to see how far you've come, cousin.
337180	340060	And I am confident that you shall make your way eventually.
340860	342980	I shall look forward to our conversations then.
343940	349300	It feels unseemly to make contact from that most unpleasant boatman's stash of ill-gotten wares.
349840	351720	Nonetheless, this was an opportunity.
352140	354160	You're difficult to track there in the depths, cousin.
354600	357280	Though the boatman Charon thankfully is proving of some help.
358020	360000	I thought we were on better terms, cousin.
360000	364040	I ask only for your cooperation, yet still you turn your back.
364900	367200	I'm disappointed you would spurn me like this, cousin.
367960	371220	Know that I retaliate not out of spite, but by necessity.
372360	374740	You'd choose one of my relatives instead of me.
375240	377360	Though I myself was first to contact you.
378480	381100	Alas, I must respond to you in kind.
382060	384280	Upon Olympus, I'm your closest confidant.
384780	387280	You'd best remember this before you spurn me again.
387840	391020	We Olympians, we are a prideful family, cousin.
391420	395260	You cannot simply choose a favorite without spurring one of us to wrath.
396300	398440	Let's continue on already, Zagreus.
398840	402720	There isn't any point in feuding and there's much to do before your quest is done.
403540	408300	Now then, I hope we can move past this little incident and keep our focus on the task at hand.
408800	411800	I'm satisfied we understand each other better now, don't we?
412200	414860	What do you say we carry on and get you from this place?
414860	417840	All is forgiven, Zagreus, and I take no offense.
418420	422000	Exacting vengeance is just something we Olympians all do from time to time.
423020	425300	I'd say I've bickered with you quite enough for now, cousin.
425740	427920	Let us continue down a more productive path.
428880	431260	This is an unexpected gesture, cousin.
431720	434760	I do appreciate it, though please do not feel obliged.
435160	438080	I offer you my friendship, not a loan to be repaid.
438620	441380	You are most gracious, cousin, to extend this offering.
441940	447020	You honor me, yet I would ask you think of your well-being for the time, not mine.
447580	451880	Well, it simply isn't in my nature to allow such offerings to go unanswered, noble cousin.
452560	455560	In turn, I wish for you to have this with my compliments.
456340	461700	You brandished the eternal spear we call Varatha, so then it wasn't lost during the war.
462200	464780	A magnificent weapon in deserving hands.
465360	467580	Why, you wield Korinakt the Heartseeker.
468140	472280	I never took you for an archer, though the power of that bow is undeniable.
472980	473680	Use it wisely.
474300	476280	You bear Aegis, the original itself.
476920	479600	My own shield was forged much later in its image.
480100	482280	You'll have to tell me someday how you found it.
482520	484160	You're badly injured, aren't you, cousin?
484840	488380	I wish that I could wield the pain away, though at least I can provide you this.
489220	490460	Look at you, Zagreus.
490680	493420	You're barely fit to fight from all the injury that you've sustained.
494060	496320	I'll try to keep you going for as long as possible.
497060	498420	I greet you, cousin.
498940	500580	I've come to offer my support.
501320	502580	Wisdom guides you, cousin.
503460	504460	I am most grateful.
504980	506100	I thank you, cousin.
507140	508420	How thoughtful, Zagreus.
509360	510560	You are most generous.
510880	511920	You honor me.
512420	513520	Thank you, Zagreus.
513940	515360	My blessing be with you.
516160	517580	I commend you for your efforts.
518380	519900	If you've a moment, Zagreus.
520200	525480	One of my relatives has claimed that I usurp your time, so I invited her to contact you.
525480	527780	Well, I suppose that's settled, then.
528080	531480	I'm afraid such interactions aren't uncommon here amongst my family.
532060	533940	But what's a family without flaws?
534740	536820	I wonder, dearest Aphrodite,
537180	540760	whether you'd be willing to repeat such things directly to my countenance.
541340	543440	I'm glad we understand each other, then.
543680	548200	It would be most embarrassing to be caught bickering amongst ourselves in front of Zagreus.
548980	551900	Except you see, dear cousin, that some members of our family
551900	554000	are predisposed toward the unspeakable.
554000	556980	I caution you around my half-brother as all.
557360	558280	Now, carry on.
558620	561320	You only do as you see fit, Lord Ares.
561960	565400	Mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all.
566040	568020	I understand you've made your choice, cousin.
568380	572160	And I, in turn, now have my family's reputation to uphold.
572680	575500	If you had given due consideration to this matter,
575800	577760	then I doubt you would have chosen this outcome.
578720	582280	No one in our family can avoid taking sides forever, Zagreus.
582280	585760	But you can take the more sensible side, at least.
586200	588120	A senseless, punishable choice.
588780	592160	But if you wish to face the consequences, so be it.
592860	595500	You could have avoided this outcome any number of ways,
595580	597860	yet still you risk incurring my wrath.
598780	602220	Are you testing the limits of my patience with you, Zagreus?
602600	605100	Then I shall test your limits, in turn.
605460	608740	I knew there was a possibility that you would side against me once again.
609120	612120	But your doing so never ceases to amaze, cousin.
612840	615360	If this is your idea of humor, Zagreus,
615440	618980	then I shall make it clear to you again that I am unamused.
619640	623080	I think we understand by now that when you test my patience,
623480	625740	I shall test your ability to survive.
626340	628180	We've better things to do, I think,
628180	631220	than fight amongst ourselves over a matter such as this.
631520	634240	I would very much prefer to think we both know better
634240	637060	than to let old grudges stew forever, Zagreus.
637540	640380	You see, I have my father's temper, Zagreus.
640380	645300	I am able to keep it in check, though I expect you to do your part.
646060	649340	Conflict between the members of our family is inevitable, Zagreus.
649780	652040	All we can do is learn and grow from it.
652400	654880	I see no benefit to staying angry, cousin.
655360	658680	I promised Nyx that I would help rather than hinder you.
659140	662700	Your father also made some questionable choices, Zagreus.
662900	665020	But all of us are family, after all.
665740	667420	I shall not keep you, Zagreus,
667420	671220	except to offer you some of my power to improve your chances of escape.
671700	673460	Now quickly choose and go.
674160	677180	Remain relentless in your effort to escape, dear cousin.
677800	682080	In spite of all our differences, perseverance is a quality we all possess.
682880	685720	You can always count upon assistance from me, Zagreus.
685960	690020	I always shall prioritize the needs of our family above everything else.
690400	693580	Let my voice be a glimmer in the darkness, noble cousin.
693580	698020	Though may the blessing I am about to provide be even more than that.
698600	701480	I take it you have a plan in mind this time for how you're going to escape,
701660	702220	don't you, cousin?
702980	704520	I shall not keep you, Zagreus,
704740	708140	except to offer you my power to improve your chances of escape.
709100	711220	Remain relentless in your effort, Zagreus,
711460	713960	for perseverance is a quality we all possess.
714980	719480	I and your family on Olympus all stand ready to support you in your efforts, noble cousin.
720080	723820	Remember, doubt and hesitancy are your real enemies, cousin.
724780	727920	I know that you are more than capable even without my power, cousin,
728340	729440	but just in case.
729960	733780	Envision your success and choose the means by which you shall achieve it, Zagreus.
734360	736540	I shall not offer empty words, dear cousin.
736900	738960	I shall instead offer you this.
739500	741600	With our ferocity combined, cousin,
741840	744540	what chances do your father's forces even have?
745360	748480	My support alone is not enough to see you through this, Zagreus,
748480	750400	but it certainly shall help.
751500	756280	Your foes shall soon find it impossible to overcome your strength combined with mine.
756720	760600	I've every confidence that you shall imminently put my blessing to good use.
761240	763660	Let not your sense of purpose waver, Zagreus.
764060	765880	Visualize the outcome you desire.
766420	768140	Make not the same mistake twice,
768220	771120	and you shall always grow wiser, no matter what else.
771520	775840	I shall do everything within my power to defend you from the perils of your journey, Zagreus.
776420	781340	Take heed against your father's legions, Zagreus, and take also my power.
781940	785440	Do not forget that changing strategy can be the key to victory, cousin.
786440	790020	I cannot glean the details of your predicament right now, cousin,
790240	791640	though maybe this shall help.
792400	797440	The might and honor of Olympus shield you against the darkness and the dead, Zagreus.
798440	802820	I take it having an impenetrable defense against your enemies may be of some use, cousin.
803380	807640	I'm not in any mood to trifle with your father's nonsense this time, Zagreus,
808120	809020	so use this.
809600	812820	These are among the mightiest defenses I can offer, Zagreus.
813220	814480	Choose wisely, then.
814760	819080	I've readied several of my most potent blessings so your victory can be achieved, cousin.
820080	824560	Observe, dear cousin, for this time I offer you uncommonly superior protection.
825140	828300	The riverboatman Charon is beholden to your father's realm,
828400	830880	but seems agreeable enough for a fair price.
830880	836060	A shrewd expenditure of wealth is sometimes all that stands between a victory and sore defeat,
836320	837300	isn't that right, cousin?
837700	841120	We cannot effectively communicate with Charon from Olympus,
841380	846020	but he is amenable to certain trades and seems unfettered by your father's influence.
846820	849800	You cannot withstand your father's legions, Zagreus,
849980	855100	but if you possess one of my greatest blessings, things may unfold differently, I think.
855700	860420	Dear cousin, would that I could give to you everlasting tireless resolve.
860880	864620	Though come to think of it, this may be suited as a counterpart.
865440	869500	It seems to me that you've sustained life-draining injuries already, Zagreus,
869780	870900	but don't lose hope.
871260	873680	We can sustain you in a proper fighting shape.
874320	877760	You may have suffered many wounds but shall not perish imminently, cousin.
878240	880340	Not if I have anything to say about it.
880560	880940	Here.
881720	885920	Oh, Zagreus, your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped.
886400	890140	Nevertheless, always strive onward while you still draw breath.
890140	892160	Wisely decided, cousin.
892920	894300	A strategic choice.
895300	896880	Correct decision, Zagreus.
897420	899340	I trusted I could count on you.
899680	901920	No pleasing all upon Olympus, I suppose?
902600	903300	Very good.
903760	905720	That is, for me, at least.
906400	909020	Perhaps next time you shall cooperate with me again.
909420	912100	Wound the pride of an Olympian and pay the price.
913060	915180	Know that this could have been avoided, Zagreus.
916040	917420	You're under my protection.
918220	920120	You are untouchable for now, cousin.
920140	922640	Just let them try and stop you.
923020	924180	Become unstoppable.
925060	926640	I ought not help you thus.
927320	929420	You ask me now to aid you, is that so?
930140	932340	Are you quite serious about this, Zagreus?
933140	934820	You reached the flames of Asphodel.
935060	935700	Well done.
936220	938660	You may have quite a distance still to go,
938800	941920	but having crossed through Tartarus is no small step, cousin.
942840	945880	I see you've made it all the way to Hallodilisium, cousin.
946120	948200	A significant way toward the surface,
948200	949900	and if you could get there the one time,
950040	952020	surely you have what it takes to do it again,
952400	955100	and overcome the dangers that await therein.
955600	958720	I understand you nearly reached the surface lately, Zagreus.
959120	962900	My confidence remains unshaken that you shall get out of there eventually,
963420	967420	no matter what sorts of unknown horrors lie shrouded beyond the boundary there.
968180	970940	Were you not close to having reached the surface lately, cousin?
971380	975040	Then this can only mean some unforeseen impediment prevented your escape.
975040	978540	There must be some unconquerable force or foe awaiting you,
978560	980540	just at the border of your realm and ours.
980960	983800	We cannot even see it through a shroud of darkness there.
984220	988680	I shall make certain that your family knows it may take considerable time to surpass.
989280	991880	So fear not, for we are patient here.
992800	995660	Despite whatever difficulties you've encountered, dear cousin,
995920	998440	again and again you have never yielded.
998860	1002280	I must admit, your strength of will is quite inspiring,
1002700	1005020	for even I have doubts from time to time.
1005500	1009120	It's all the clearer to me why the goddess Nyx spoke so highly of you.
1009940	1013540	I have grown closer than expected with the goddess Nyx in all of this, cousin.
1014080	1016740	It is quite evident to me how much she cares for you.
1017260	1020160	I must admit I envy your relationship sometimes,
1020640	1023440	for I've made do without a mother's presence in my life.
1023980	1028700	Lord Ares has suggested he and goddess Nyx have grown much closer to each other in all this.
1029200	1030860	Nothing untoward, if you must know.
1030860	1033980	Ares and I have often disagreed about so many things,
1034080	1036940	and yet we share a fondness for the knight herself, it seems.
1037540	1039360	Sometimes I think about the goddess Nyx
1039360	1042360	and how I long for her to be the mother that I never had, cousin.
1043100	1045340	Is it improper that I say such things to you?
1046220	1049160	One would expect I would already have somebody on Olympus yet.
1049720	1052360	It often feels as though I am the mother here.
1052920	1055020	You arrived sooner than anticipated, cousin,
1055400	1057660	and my estimations seldom are inaccurate.
1058120	1059340	All for the best, of course.
1059340	1061760	Perhaps you're simply faster than I thought.
1062680	1065480	The biting cold surrounding you must mean the goddess of seasons
1065480	1068260	decided to take an interest in your struggle, Zagreus.
1068880	1071380	I did not count on Demeter being a part of this.
1071980	1074520	Take heart, though use discretion around her.
1075280	1077560	You bear my owl pendant, noble cousin.
1078040	1081240	Wherever it should go, I faintly see it shimmer from afar,
1081620	1086020	even where you reside, for owls see in total darkness, after all.
1086400	1089160	You got your hands on Malfon, the twin fists I see.
1089340	1092940	No ordinary weapon, prone to fits of savagery,
1093100	1094980	quite unbecoming of a well-trained warrior.
1095580	1098440	Then watch yourself and throw not caution to the wind.
1099140	1102600	The Rail of Adamate itself has found its way into your hands, cousin.
1103240	1105400	A malignant thing if you were to ask me,
1105560	1107680	and not one I would ever use myself.
1108120	1110360	Unless perhaps I had no other choice.
1110820	1113140	I suppose it must have been that way for you.
1113920	1118120	The goddess Nyx has indicated you possess a list of prophecies from the three fates.
1118120	1120720	I've such a list upon Olympus here.
1121140	1123060	It seems to be connected to your own,
1123380	1125640	as several prophecies already are fulfilled.
1126200	1128360	Isn't it such an honor to urge fate along?
1128840	1131720	My, how very generous of you to offer me this gift.
1132140	1136200	I'm very grateful, though I ask that you not go out of your way on my account.
1136740	1138440	Let's please stay focused here.
1139140	1143560	I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus.
1143640	1146820	But I would ask that you save it for when your task is complete.
1146820	1149760	You've more important matters to attend to now.
1150560	1154320	I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus.
1154720	1157120	But I would ask you to save it for a better time.
1157560	1159940	You've more important matters to attend to now.
1160920	1163100	Perhaps there really is no time quite like the present
1163100	1165680	when it comes to showing thanks to one another, my dear cousin.
1166620	1168620	You've opened my eyes to the possibility,
1168880	1171700	though I remain steadfast in my resolve to fight for you.
1173060	1175940	Zagreus, when Nyx revealed herself to me
1175940	1177300	and I first learned of you,
1177540	1180360	I saw it as an opportunity to bridge the great divide
1180360	1182300	between Olympus and your father's realm.
1182980	1185740	But having had all these glimpses into who you are,
1186180	1189620	it is an even greater honor to have forged this partnership with you.
1190780	1192520	Supporting you through your ordeal, cousin,
1193040	1197420	it's reminiscent of the thrill of doing battle by the side of those whom I hold dear.
1197860	1201840	I may be safe upon our mountaintop, though I am with you there as well,
1202180	1204900	for every well-earned victory and bitter loss.
1204900	1210080	Noble cousin, my lord father has taken keen interest in your journey and your plight,
1210380	1212740	and seeks to aid you with the thunder of heaven itself.
1213280	1215360	And you've my support as well, of course.
1215960	1220540	Lord father, would that I could settle even more such matters quickly and discreetly
1220540	1224560	so that only the most vital of them rise up to the level of your notice, sir.
1224900	1228600	Though I'm certain Zagreus and I are very grateful you have intervened.
1229220	1234400	Your predicament has pulled our family together, united in a desire to assist you, cousin.
1234900	1238580	Even those who typically do not think much of those other than themselves.
1239760	1243400	The world is not all lies and deceit as you make it out to be, Aphrodite.
1243800	1247400	Sometimes a lending of assistance is no more than it appears to be.
1247900	1250560	Now either back up Zagreus or stand aside.
1251560	1256580	When I first notified lord father Zeus and other members of our family of your existence, Zagreus,
1256960	1262420	it was uncle Poseidon here who first leapt up and pledged his power over sea and earth to you.
1262800	1264100	Is that not so, uncle?
1264780	1268820	Surely my cleverness comes from your brother and yourself, lord uncle Poseidon.
1269000	1273500	And I would only add my feeling is we've more than enough children in this family,
1273940	1276180	thus no further need for more of them for now.
1276920	1281280	Some members of our family do not yet fully understand just how precarious your situation
1281280	1281900	is, cousin.
1282460	1287440	My lord Dionysus here, he goes about as though this is a festive matter of some sort.
1287980	1291120	Perhaps lord Dionysus here is the true god of strategy,
1291120	1294840	as it appears he is uncannily aware of my next move, cousin.
1295540	1301160	Although be that as it may, I shall attempt to remain focused on your situation, not his feast.
1302180	1304480	I bring to you the lady Demeter, cousin.
1304880	1309500	I've asked that she please rest assured knowing we have your matter well under control,
1310080	1314540	though in her infinite compassion she has taken up your cause nevertheless.
1315540	1319700	Please do not mind the lady Demeter's good-natured sense of humor, Zagreus.
1319700	1325300	She and my father often like to jest with one another, even in the most difficult times.
1325920	1327920	Is this some kind of offering for me?
1328340	1329440	No, hold a moment.
1329620	1330900	This appears to be a message.
1331600	1332240	Part of one.
1333000	1334940	Then can this mean...
1334940	1336360	I have to notify the others.
1336740	1340020	I trust they also have received something from you, or shortly shall.
1340740	1343620	It was my privilege to have visited your father's house
1343620	1346340	and briefly had a chance to meet you, Zagreus.
1346920	1349420	Nyx and your mother each are very shrewd.
1349420	1351380	Perhaps you've taken after both of them.
1351760	1357060	As for your new responsibilities, exposing weak points and defenses is my specialty.
1358040	1360700	It's fortunate your troubles with your mother were resolved.
1361280	1362240	Persephone, I mean.
1362760	1366920	To think I led all of my family to believe your mother was the goddess Nyx instead.
1367480	1371240	It seems I was an unwitting accomplice to a bit of a deception there.
1371620	1374480	But Nyx, I know she merely tried to help.
1375380	1375940	Zagreus.
1375940	1380700	Perhaps it is a fancy of imagination, but it seems almost as though, this time,
1380940	1384040	you bear the blessing of your own father.
1384800	1387760	If Lord Hades is assisting you in any way in this,
1388160	1391880	then I shall hold out hope that your relationship yet has capacity to heal.
1392280	1393840	To some extent, at least.
1394360	1396780	So you've another blessing from Lord Hades, then?
1397380	1401960	Zagreus, I'm under no delusion you and your father shall become the closest friends from here.
1402480	1407080	Nevertheless, I do believe it's possible to move forward even such a relationship as yours.
1407780	1409020	Believe me, I know.
